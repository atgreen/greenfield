Greenfield: the virtual infrastructure demo generator
===================================================== 
Greenfield is an open source project to build demo-capable backend IT
infrastructure based mostly on Red Hat products and technologies.

More specifically, the goal of the project is to provide the means for
performing hands-off virtual deployments of a complete suite of IT
infrastructure tools suitable for the purpose of demonstration on a
laptop or similar.  Key characteristics of the project include:

* *Offline Friendly*.  All installable media are downloaded in advance
to support offline deployments, and to conserve bandwidth over
multiple deployments.

* *Ease of Use*. Basic configuration is performed through a text-based
GUI configuration tool borrowed from the Linux kernel project.
Deployments and tear-downs are simple one line commands.

* *Supports the Full Stack*. Nested virtualization is leveraged where
possible to demonstrate virtualization technologies such as RHEV and
RHEL-OSP.

* *A Useful Learning Tool*. The configuration and build scripts are
intended to be well documented, demonstrating how various components
in the stack may be integrated.  Links to reference documentation are
provided where appropriate.
